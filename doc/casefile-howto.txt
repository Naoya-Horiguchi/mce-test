casefile is used to save what test cases will be used finally. Here is an
example to create it by hand.

1. Copy one or more files from directory groups, say function, to somewhere.
2. Open this file and remove all "on|off" at the end of line from every line.
3. Delete unnecessary test cases. Here one line corresponds to one test case.
4. Save this file and rename it to any name you prefer.
5. When you execute runmcetest, use parameter "-l" along with this file.
